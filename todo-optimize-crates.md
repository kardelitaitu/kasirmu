# Optimize our own crates — census (round 1)

**Status:** OPEN — listing round. No code touched, no axis chosen.
**Date:** 2026-09-25 · **Branch:** `0.0.40` · **Recorded against:** HEAD at time of measurement.

---

## 0. Scope — "our crates", stated so the fence cannot drift later

**In scope (39 workspace members).** `Cargo.toml` globs `crates/*`, `modules/*`, `platform/*`
and lists `foundation`, `apps/cloud-server`, `apps/desktop-tauri`, `apps/mobile-tauri`
explicitly. Those 39 manifests are the whole subject of this todo.

**Out of scope, explicitly:**

- **Third-party dependencies.** Not this todo. Nothing below measures `Cargo.lock`, and no
  dependency version, feature or profile knob is proposed here. (The `[profile.*]` settings in
  the workspace manifest are third-party-oriented and are therefore *context*, not work items.)
- **The three excluded standalone crates** — `tools/fuzz`, `tools/fuzz/hfuzz`,
  `scripts/updater-compat-check`. Each pins its own graph by design and must not perturb the
  workspace lockfile (`Cargo.toml:29-33`).
- **Non-Rust surfaces** — the Go licence server (`apps/license-server`), the TypeScript UI, the
  Astro website, SQL migrations as such.

**What is not yet decided:** what "optimize" means here — compile time, binary size, dead-code
volume, test wall-clock, or crate-graph hygiene. Round 1 produces the list only. §5 turns the
list into candidate axes; picking one is yours.

## 1. The census — 39 crates, measured

`lines` is raw physical `wc -l` over every `*.rs` under each member (blank and comment lines
included) — a size proxy, **not** a complexity measure. `tests` counts `#[test]` +
`#[tokio::test]` attributes found in the tree; it counts attributes, not executed cases, so a
parameterised or macro-generated test may be one attribute and many cases. `t/kl` is test
attributes per 1,000 lines.

## 2. Cross-check against the repo's own counter — and the 3-file gap

`stats.json` (regenerated today, `0e39fc288`) reports Rust at **1,235 files / 455,869 lines**
repo-wide; the walk in §1 totals **1,223 / 455,174**. The three excluded standalone crates
account for **9 files / 568 lines** of that (`tools/fuzz` 7/399,
`scripts/updater-compat-check` 2/169, `tools/fuzz/hfuzz` 0/0).

That leaves **3 files / 127 lines unattributed**. `stats.json` is not stale, so the gap is a
counting-rule difference or a mid-flight edit by a concurrent session in this shared checkout.
**Not chased further** — it is 0.03% of volume and cannot change any ranking below. Flagged so
the two numbers are never quoted as if they were the same instrument.

---

## 3. What the list says — four readings, all from the census alone

**F1 — Volume is concentrated, and one crate is a third of it.** `kasirmu-core` is 33.3% of
our Rust. The top five are 70.7%; the top ten are 86.6%. Any crate-level optimization that
does not touch `kasirmu-core` is working on at most two thirds of the surface, and probably
less: the bottom 29 crates together are 13.4%.

**F2 — Tests are the majority of our Rust, and they own the largest compile units.** 476 files
matching `*_tests.rs` or `*/tests/*.rs` hold **240,257 lines — 52.8%** of everything in §1;
production code is 214,917 lines (47.2%). The nine largest single files in the workspace are
all test files:

| file | lines |
|---|---|
| `crates/kasirmu-core/src/db/sales_tests.rs` | 4,933 |
| `crates/kasirmu-core/src/db/kds_tests.rs` | 3,784 |
| `crates/kasirmu-core/src/migrations_tests.rs` | 3,465 |
| `apps/desktop-tauri/src/commands/topology/topology_command_tests.rs` | 2,895 |
| `apps/cloud-server/src/sync_api_tests.rs` | 2,642 |
| `platform/sync/src/queue_tests.rs` | 2,623 |
| `crates/kasirmu-core/src/db/products_tests.rs` | 2,586 |
| `apps/desktop-tauri/src/commands/registration_gate_tests.rs` | 2,500 |
| `crates/kasirmu-bridge/src/pos_tests.rs` | 2,399 |

Read the consequence plainly: whatever makes the workspace slow to compile is more likely to
be sitting in a test module than in production code. That inverts the usual instinct, which is
to look at `src/` and never at `*_tests.rs`.

**F3 — The largest production files are the obvious split candidates, if splitting is the chosen
axis.** Top of the non-test list:

| file | lines |
|---|---|
| `crates/kasirmu-api/src/pg.rs` | 2,904 |
| `crates/kasirmu-bridge/src/pos.rs` | 2,339 |
| `crates/kasirmu-bridge/src/staff.rs` | 1,692 |
| `platform/sync/src/queue.rs` | 1,563 |
| `apps/mobile-tauri/src/commands/pos.rs` | 1,543 |
| `crates/kasirmu-bridge/src/auth.rs` | 1,527 |
| `apps/desktop-tauri/src/lib.rs` | 1,464 |
| `crates/kasirmu-bridge/src/settings.rs` | 1,450 |
| `crates/kasirmu-core/src/subscription.rs` | 1,309 |
| `crates/kasirmu-bridge/src/data.rs` | 1,270 |

**F4 — The module tier is a rounding error, and four of it are stubs.** All 14 `modules/*`
crates are 2.9% of volume (13,276 lines). Four of them — `kitchen` (247), `purchasing` (243),
`giftcards` (233), `promotions` (230) — share the same shape: three files, ~8 test attributes,
the "planned verticals" stubs the workspace manifest registers ahead of implementation
(`Cargo.toml:76-77`). No crate-level optimization is justified by this tier on size grounds.

**Test density is uneven and worth one look, later.** `foundation` runs 63.2 test attributes per
1k lines; `modules-tax` 55.3, `modules-staff` 52.6. At the other end, `kasirmu-app`
(desktop-tauri) runs **7.5** — 199 attributes across 26,490 lines, the lowest of the ten
largest crates, and roughly a quarter of `kasirmu-core`'s density. That is a coverage signal,
not a performance one, and it does not by itself mean anything is wrong: a Tauri shell is
largely command wiring, which resists unit testing. Noted, not acted on.

---

## 4. What this census does NOT tell us — no instrument was run

Everything below is unmeasured. It is listed so that no one mistakes §1 for evidence about it.

| claim nobody has earned yet | instrument that would earn it |
|---|---|
| which crates are slow to compile | `cargo build --timings` (per-crate wall clock), or `cargo +nightly -Z timings` |
| which crates cost binary size | `cargo bloat --release` (needs install), or `cargo build --release` + `size` on the artifact |
| how much of our code is unreachable | `cargo-udeps` (nightly) for deps; `#[warn(dead_code)]` counts for our own — not run |
| fan-in / fan-out between our crates | `cargo tree -e normal --invert <crate>` per crate |
| how much is behind feature flags | per-crate `[features]` read + `cargo tree -f` |
| test wall-clock per crate | `cargo test -p <crate> -- --report-time`, or `cargo nextest run` (per-test timing) |
| whether any crate is a dependency cycle | `cargo tree` / a cycle check — not run |

Build profiles, for context only — not a work item:
`[profile.release]` is `opt-level = 3`, `lto = "thin"`, `codegen-units = 8`,
`strip = "symbols"`, `overflow-checks = true` (`Cargo.toml:209-214`);
`[profile.release.package.kasirmu-app]` overrides to `codegen-units = 1`, `opt-level = "s"`,
`strip = true` (`:221-224`); `[profile.dev]` is `opt-level = 0`, `incremental = true`,
`codegen-units = 256` with `debug = "line-tables-only"` (`:226-238`, the 413.5 MB Android
debug `.so` measurement is recorded there); `[profile.test]` and `[profile.tdd]` inherit from
dev (`:261-278`).

---

## 5. Candidate axes — unfunded, pick one

Each is stated with the instrument that decides whether it is worth doing. **None is approved.**

| | axis | what it would do | deciding instrument | first thing to measure |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | **Compile time** | Split or feature-gate the hot compile units (F2, F3) so an incremental build touches less | `cargo build --timings` | per-crate wall clock on a cold then warm build |
| **B** | **Test-suite wall clock** | Attack the 52.8% (F2) — the largest test modules are also the slowest to compile and link | `cargo nextest run` / `-- --report-time` | per-crate test time vs. LOC, to see if size predicts time |
| **C** | **Dead / unreachable code** | Delete unused `pub` items and decide what to do with the four stub modules (F4) | `dead_code` warnings + `cargo-udeps` | warning inventory per crate |
| **D** | **Crate-graph hygiene** | Reduce fan-in to `kasirmu-core`, break cycles, move what does not belong | `cargo tree --invert` | the actual edge list between our 39 crates |
| **E** | **Binary size** | Act on F3 and the release profile for the two Tauri shells | `cargo bloat` | release artifact size per app, before/after |

**My read, offered not imposed:** A and B are the only two with a plausible order-of-magnitude
payoff, because both attack the same 52.8% — tests — from different ends, and F2 says that is
where the mass is. C is cheap and satisfying but the module tier is 2.9%, so its ceiling is low
unless the real dead code is in `kasirmu-core`. D is architectural and slow to verify. E is
bounded by the shells and is the only one with a user-visible number at the end. If you want
the largest measured effect per unit of risk, fund **B first**, with `--timings` run once to
confirm the guess rather than trust it.

---

## 6. Rules for whichever phase gets funded

- **Fence:** not set yet — this round is doc-only, nothing was edited. The funded phase names
  its files explicitly here before any edit, and the fence widens only by a decision recorded
  in this file.
- **Commit prefixes** (one per area touched; a single-crate prefix would misattribute):
  `perf(kasirmu-core):` · `perf(kasirmu-bridge):` · `perf(mobile-tauri):` ·
  `perf(desktop-tauri):` · `perf(cloud-server):` · `perf(platform-sync):` · `test(<crate>):` ·
  `chore(cargo):` for manifest-only edits.
- **Acceptance must be a command that was run**, with its output quoted in the section that
  closes the phase — per the repo rule that `done-todo-*` is earned only when the acceptance
  command ran and passed. "Faster" without a before/after number does not close a phase.
- **Version is locked at 0.0.40.** No manifest edit in this todo touches a version number.

## Appendix — reproduce the census

```bash
# per-crate: files, lines, test attributes

  n=$(find "$d" -name '*.rs' -type f | wc -l)
  l=$(find "$d" -name '*.rs' -type f | xargs cat | wc -l)
  t=$(grep -rn '#\[test\]\|#\[tokio::test\]' "$d" --include='*.rs' | wc -l)
  echo "$pkg|$d|$n|$l|$t"
done | sort -t'|' -k4 -rn

# largest files, all and production-only
find crates modules platform foundation apps/cloud-server apps/desktop-tauri apps/mobile-tauri \
  -name '*.rs' -type f | xargs wc -l | grep -v ' total$' | sort -rn | head -20

# test volume
find crates modules platform foundation apps/cloud-server apps/desktop-tauri apps/mobile-tauri \
  \( -name '*_tests.rs' -o -path '*/tests/*.rs' \) | xargs cat | wc -l
```

Caveats carried by the numbers: `lines` includes blank and comment lines; `tests` counts
attributes rather than executed cases; both were taken in a shared checkout where another
session may have been editing, so a re-run on a quiet tree can differ by a few hundred lines.
