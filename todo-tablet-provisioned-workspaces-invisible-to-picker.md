<!-- Audit stamp: 2026-10-03 · DSH · status: MEASURED ON DEVICE (root cause proven, not yet repaired)
     Reproduced on Redmi 23073RPBFG (Android 15) with a debug build of `0.0.41` (mu.kasir.mobile),
     installed 2026-10-03 06:53, exercised over CDP. Every figure below was read off the device
     or its pulled SQLite files during this pass; nothing is inferred from source alone. -->

**Symptom.** A freshly provisioned tablet that chose **"Offline only"** on the setup wizard
lands on a home screen showing the EMPTY workspace picker — a single "Add Workspace" card —
even though provisioning created four active workspaces. The workspace grid therefore never
renders its populated branch, and the owner has no way into the app they just set up.

## What was measured

Provisioning reported success (the wizard advanced to the staff login screen), the owner could
log in, and `list_workspaces` returned `200`/ok at the IPC layer. Everything *looked* healthy.
The device DB says otherwise:

| Fact | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `users` | 1 (`budi`, `role-owner`) | `kasir.db` |
| `provisioning` | 1 row, `mode='local'` | `kasir.db` |
| `workspace_instances` | **4, all `status='active'`** | `kasir.db` |
| their `location_id` | `loc-000000000000000018dadc902eb343820000` | `kasir.db` |
| `locations` | 1 (`Warung Uji`, `is_primary=1`) | `kasir.db` |

The four instances are `restaurant-pos`, `kds`, `warehouse`, `admin`. Running the picker's own
owner-bypass SQL against `kasir.db` returns all four:

```
SELECT wi.id, wi.type_key ... FROM workspace_instances wi
  JOIN workspace_types wt ON wi.type_key = wt.key
 WHERE wi.location_id = ?1 AND wi.status = 'active'   -- ?1 = 'loc-0000…820000'
--> 4 rows
```

## Root cause — the picker reads a DIFFERENT database than provisioning wrote

`provision_device` writes the location, the four workspaces, the owner and the roles **into the
global database** (`kasir.db`) — `crates/kasirmu-bridge/src/setup.rs:370` takes `ctx.lock_global()`
and hands that connection to `kasirmu_core::db::provisioning::provision_device`. It never opens a
store database.

`list_workspaces` reads them from a **per-store database** —
`crates/kasirmu-bridge/src/workspaces.rs:150` calls `ctx.db_manager.open_store(&store_id)`, and
`StoreDatabaseManager::open_store` (`platform/core/src/database/manager.rs:73`) treats `store_id`
as a **filename stem**, building `store-<store_id>.sqlite`.

`store_id` is resolved by `resolve_boot_store`, which returns the **primary location id** —
`loc-000000000000000018dadc902eb343820000` (confirmed by invoking the command on the device; it
returned exactly that string). `open_store` therefore looks for

```
store-loc-000000000000000018dadc902eb343820000.sqlite
```

which **did not exist**, so `open_store` **created it empty** and applied migrations. The picker
then queried an empty database and correctly reported zero workspaces. The device file listing
after the failed picker load shows the artefact of that creation:

```
store-default.sqlite                                  4096 B   (also empty)
store-default.sqlite-wal                           4062352 B
store-loc-000000000000000018dadc902eb343820000.sqlite   4096 B   <-- created by the read
store-loc-000000000000000018dadc902eb343820000.sqlite-wal 4062352 B
```

So the id is used as a **location id** on the write side and as a **database name** on the read
side, and the two never meet. The mismatch is silent in both directions: the write succeeds, the
read succeeds, and only the row count is wrong.

## Why this is a NEW INSTANCE of a KNOWN defect

`.agents/planning/review-backlog-codebase-review.md:54` already names the structural cause:

> **P0-4 … Two-database split-brain: The tablet writes sales to the global file and nearly
> everything about those sales to per-store files.**

This report adds a sixth symptom to that family, and the first one observed on hardware: the
tablet **provisions into the global file** and **reads the picker from a per-store file**.

ADR-56 anticipated that workspaces live in the store database —
`docs/decisions/2026-09-21-adr56-first-run-provisioning.md:321-322` states "`'default'` is what
this store database calls 'the one tenant it holds'". Two deviations from that intent compound
here:

1. `provision_device` writes to the **global** db, not the store db.
2. ADR-56 §2.6 option **B** creates a **generated** location id
   (`crates/kasirmu-core/src/db/provisioning.rs:462` `let location_id = new_id();`, `:738`
   `format!("loc-{nanos:032x}{seq:04x}")`), so the install's primary location is no longer the
   `'default'` id the read path was written against.

## Acceptance for a repair

A device provisioned via "Offline only" must show its four workspaces on the home screen, and
`store-<generated-location-id>.sqlite` must not be created at all. Either the write side must
target the store db, or the read side must read the db the write side uses — the choice belongs
to P0-4's owner, not to this report. The reproduction is cheap: install a debug APK, `pm clear`,
provision offline, log in, and count `.workspace-grid > *` over CDP — it is `1` today and must
become `5` (4 workspaces + the add card).

# SECOND DEFECT (same test pass) — provisioning writes no subscription row,
# so every tool locks on a fresh offline install

<!-- Audit stamp: 2026-10-03 · DSH · status: MEASURED ON DEVICE. Independent of the defect
     above: this one is a missing write, not a database split. Both were observed on the same
     provisioned tablet, and either alone is enough to make a fresh install unusable. -->

**Symptom.** Every one of the home screen's 17 tool cards renders locked — `aria-disabled="true"`,
`data-testid="workspace-tool-card-locked"`, each captioned "Subscription inactive". The owner
cannot open Topology Editor, Staff Management, Settings, Data, or anything else. Combined with
the defect above the install is a dead end: no workspaces to enter AND no tool to create one.

## What was measured

`get_subscription_capabilities`, invoked on the device, returned:

```json
{"tier":"free","status":"unavailable","state":"unavailable","features":{},
 "maxLocations":1,"maxPosInstances":1,"maxWarehouses":0,"maxKdsScreens":0,"maxStaffUsers":1}
```

and the device database agrees — the table is empty:

| Table | Rows |
|---|---|
| `tenant_subscription` | **0** |
| `tenant_plans` | 0 |
| `settings` | 17 (none subscription- or licence-related) |
| `workspace_instances` | 4 |
| `users` | 1 |

## Root cause — a documented contract that the code does not honour

`crates/kasirmu-core/migrations/20260813_init.sql:1512-1520` removed the migration-seeded
subscription and states what replaces it, verbatim:

> The five default workspace instances and the BOOTSTRAP_FREE subscription **were REMOVED here**
> (ADR #56 §2.6 option C). ... **They are now created by `provision_device`'s single transaction**,
> alongside the location row they reference.

`provision_device` does not do this, and not by oversight in one branch — the write does not
exist. Its transaction has exactly six steps and none of them touch the table
(`crates/kasirmu-core/src/db/provisioning.rs:434-528`):

| Step | Line | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| 2 | `:443` | `seed_default_roles()` |
| 3 | `:462-509` | the `locations` row + `create_workspaces_in_tx` |
| 4 | `:514` | `create_owner_in_tx` |
| 5 | `:520` | `write_provisioning_settings` |
| 6 | `:523` | the `provisioning` marker |

A grep for `tenant_subscription` / `TenantSubscription` across `provisioning.rs` returns **no
matches at all**. So the migration comment describes work that was never written.

## Why it locks every tool

The lock is the documented fail-closed behaviour, not a bug in the gate. The backend downgrades
missing subscription data to Free entitlements with `state: 'unavailable'`
(`ui/src/contexts/SubscriptionContext.tsx:40-46`), and `WorkspaceHome` treats only three states as
open (`ui/src/features/workspaces/WorkspaceHome.tsx:419-423`):

```ts
const validityOpen =
  subscriptionState === 'active' ||
  subscriptionState === 'grace' ||
  subscriptionState === 'loading';
if (!validityOpen) return 'subscription';   // every tool, including the free ones
```

`unavailable` is not in that set, so the FIRST gate rejects all 17 tools before the tier check
(`:425`) is ever reached. The measured `features: {}` also shows the tier carries no entitlements
at all, so even a repair of the state would leave `maxWarehouses: 0` / `maxKdsScreens: 0`
blocking two of the four provisioned workspaces.

## Note on intent

ADR-56 §2.4 (§2.4 at `docs/decisions/2026-09-21-adr56-first-run-provisioning.md:580`) makes the
`local` tier the **default**, not a fallback, precisely so a merchant without connectivity can
still run. A `local` install that locks all 17 tools is the opposite of that decision, so the
missing row reads as an un-implemented step rather than a deliberate denial.

## Acceptance for a repair

On a device provisioned offline, `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tenant_subscription` is `1` and the home
screen renders tool cards that are NOT `workspace-tool-card-locked` for at least the free-tier
tools. Reproduction is the same as the section above and equally cheap, and the assertion is one
IPC call plus one DOM count:

```
get_subscription_capabilities -> state must not be 'unavailable'
document.querySelectorAll('[data-testid=workspace-tool-card-locked]').length -> must fall
```

## Evidence retention

Device-side files pulled during this pass: `kasir.db` (+wal) and `store-default.sqlite` (+wal) in
the host temp dir, and the CDP evaluation transcripts quoted above.
